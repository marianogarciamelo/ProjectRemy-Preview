## 💡 Inspiration

JustCookBro was inspired by a personal realization after studying abroad — seeing how strongly many European cultures value home cooking, fresh ingredients, and intentional eating. In contrast, it became clear how common it is in the U.S., especially among younger generations, to rely on eating out or ordering in.

This app was created to help shift that mindset — to **encourage cooking at home**, to **romanticize everyday meals**, and to make cooking feel fun, expressive, and worth sharing. It’s about building a space where friends can swap recipes, share what they’re making, and form a community around the joy of everyday food.

Apps like **BeReal** and **Beer Buddy** helped shape the vision, showing how casual, social sharing can build real connection. JustCookBro brings that same energy, but focuses it on food, creativity, and homegrown moments.
